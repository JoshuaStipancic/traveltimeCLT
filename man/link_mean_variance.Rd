\title{This function allows to create the graph of the network and run the algorithm on the train set to get the mean of the autocorrelation and the mean of the residuals.}
\usage{
link_mean_variance(data, L = 5L, bins = unique(data$timeBin))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame of trips and their road level travel information, formated as \code{trips}, see \code{trips} or \code{View(data(trips))}.}

\item{L}{minimum number of observation to estimate (and not impute) parameters. Default (\code{L=5}).}

\item{bins}{a vector of predefined naming for time bins. Default \code{unique(data$timeBin)}.}
}
\description{
This function allows to create the graph of the network and run the algorithm on the train set to get the mean of the autocorrelation and the mean of the residuals.
}
\details{
returns a data frame with columns \code{(linkID.from, linkID.to, timeBin, mean, sd, imputed_mean, imputed_sd)} representing the mean and as used for each unit, while \code{imputed_mean} and \code{imputed_sd} indicate whether the calculated quantity is imputed from time bin estimates, or calculated from observed data.
