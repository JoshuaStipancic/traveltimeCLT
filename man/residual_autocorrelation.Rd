\title{Calculate mean of auto-correlation
The algorithm only keeps trips ("trips") that have more than 10 ijk links.
On these links, we use a function called "get rho" allowing to calculate the mean of
the auto-correlation of the speed with a lag up to 5 for each trip.
If desired, the function also allows calculation specifically for AM or PM timebins.}
\usage{
residual_autocorrelation(data, network_parameters, lag = 1L, nsamples = 500L)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Train dataset sampled according to time-bin.}

\item{network_parameters}{Trips that have more than 10 edges inside the train dataset sampled.}

\item{lag}{maximum lag at which to calculate the acf.  Default is 1.}

\item{nsamples}{number of random trip to sample for parameter estimation. Default is 500}
